# Online-Retail-Recommendation-System-
This project focuses on developing a product recommendaƟon system for an  online retail plaƞorm. The goal is to predict and suggest products to customers  based on the purchasing behaviors of other users.The system uses 

collaboraƟve filtering, a popular approach for recommendaƟon engines, where 

the primary technique employed is cosine similarity. By comparing the 

purchasing history of similar users, the system idenƟfies products that a target 

user might be interested in. This report provides an in-depth explanaƟon of the 

system's design, methodologies, implementaƟon, results, and future 

improvements.
